### About
This is my Bachelor's thesis project in the Hellenic Open University.

### Thesis title
Development of Widgets for the Orange data mining platform.

### abstract
This thesis is motivated to create three widgets for the Orange platform. The main goal is to study and familiarise yourself with data mining, knowledge discovery, Python language and the development environment. The first widget implements the SMOTE algorithm. SMOTE is a way to balance classes in a dataset in order to allow this dataset to be used in a machine learning model. The second widget is optics which allows clustering of data to unsupervised based on dynamic density of the tether. The third widget concerns the visualization of data based on a two-dimensional kernel-density estimate using Gaussian kernels. This widget is useful in the case where there are similarities in data capable of being hidden in other charts such as scatter plot. In addition, hidden clusters can be found, or it can even indicate whether these data form normal distributions. The development was used by VSCode, python and orange as well as three packages. Specifically, package imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn and sciPy. Orange's potential in data mining is admirable, data science is one like an art that the more you learn it, the more you like it.
