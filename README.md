### Thesis title
Development of Widgets for the Orange data mining platform.

### Abstract
This thesis is motivated to create three widgets for the Orange platform. The main goal is to study and to be familiar with data mining, knowledge discovery, Python language and the development environment. The first widget implements the SMOTE algorithm. SMOTE is a way to balance classes in a dataset in order to allow this dataset to be used in a machine learning model. The second widget is OPTICS which allows clustering of unsupervised dataset based on dynamic density of the data. The third widget is KDE-2D  and it concerns the visualization of data based on a two-dimensional kernel-density estimate using Gaussian kernels. This widget is useful in the case where there are similarities in data, capable of being hidden in other charts such as scatter plot. In addition, hidden clusters can be found, or it can even indicate whether these data form normal distributions. VSCode, python and orange as well as three packages were used in the development. Specifically, the three packages are imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn and sciPy. Orange's potential in data mining is admirable and Data Science is like art that the more you learn, the more you create.
