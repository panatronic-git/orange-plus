**About:**
This is my Bachelor's thesis project in the Hellenic Open University.

**Thesis title:**
Development of Widgets for the Orange data mining platform.

**Abstract**  

The scope of this thesis is to create three widgets for the Orange platform. The main goal is to  
study and become familiar with data mining techniques, knowledge discovery, the Python language  
and the development environment. The first widget implements the SMOTE algorithm. SMOTE is used  
to balance classes in a dataset in order to allow for the dataset to be more effectively used in  
a machine learning model. The second widget is OPTICS which allows clustering of an unsupervised  
dataset based on the dynamic density of the data. The third widget is KDE-2D and it yields a  
visualization of data based on a two-dimensional kernel-density estimate using Gaussian kernels.  
This widget is useful in cases where there are similarities in data, that are difficult to spot  
in other charts such as scatter plots. In addition, hidden clusters can be found, as well as  
indicate whether the data form normal distributions. VSCode, Python and Orange, as well as the  
following three packages were used in the development process: “imbalanced-learn”, “scikit-learn”  
and “sciPy”. Through the aforementioned development, Orange's exceptional potential in data  
mining was uncovered and an insightful understanding of Data Science concepts and techniques was  
achieved, bringing about a valuable skillset that can be expanded and built upon.
